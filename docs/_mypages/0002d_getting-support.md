# Getting support

The best way to get support on JSBSim is to register on GitHub and *watch* the repository [github.com/JSBSim-Team/jsbsim](https://github.com/JSBSim-Team/jsbsim). You can subscribe to individual conversations in issues, pull requests, and team discussions, even if you're not watching the repository or a member of the team where the conversation is occuring. If you're no longer interested in a conversation, you can unsubscribe from any future notifications.
