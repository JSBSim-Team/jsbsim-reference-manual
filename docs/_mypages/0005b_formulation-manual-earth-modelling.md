The dry air adiabatic lapse rate (DALR) is 3&nbsp;째C per 1000&nbsp;ft (304.8&nbsp;m),
or 1&nbsp;째C per 100&nbsp;m.
The saturated-air adiabatic lapse rate (SALR) is 1.5&nbsp;째C per 1000&nbsp;ft or 0.5&nbsp;째C
per 100&nbsp;m. Therefore,
$\lambda_\mathrm{SALR} = \frac{1}{2} \lambda_\mathrm{DALR}$.

The rate of change of temperature with height $h$ in the atmospheric layers at a
place and time is called its *temperature lapse rate* or simply *lapse rate*,
which is denoted by $\lambda$. The lapse rate is considered positive if the temperature
decreases with height, and vice versa.
\begin{equation}
\lambda = - \frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}h}
\label{eq:Lapse:Rate}
\end{equation}
