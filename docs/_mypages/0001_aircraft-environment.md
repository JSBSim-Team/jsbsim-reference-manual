# The Aircraft and its Environment

This part introduces, although in simple terms, the concept aircraft as a _model_.
Some standard reference systems, and the nomenclature of the aircraft will be introduced,
as well as the significant forces, moments and angles affecting the atmospheric flight.

The aircraft operates in the atmosphere, therefore the standard air
model is reviewed, along with relevant approximating functions for performance
calculations. Some atmospheric effects in non-standard conditions are briefly
reviewed.
