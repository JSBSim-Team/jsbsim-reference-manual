# Quickstart

To use JSBSim productively you are advised to assume a *programmer's attitude*. That is, until the development team sets up an automatic remote build procedure that delivers up-to-date binaries of the library, you have to download the source yourself and compile them on your platform. With the right set of tools installed on your computer, this is a painless procedure after all.
