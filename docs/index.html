<p>
JSBSim was conceived in 1996 as a lightweight, data-driven, non-linear, six-degree-of-freedom
(6DoF), batch simulation application aimed at modeling flight dynamics and control for aircraft.
Since the earliest versions, JSBSim has benefited from the open source development environment
it has grown within and from the wide variety of users that have contributed ideas for its continued
improvement.
</p>
<p>
JSBSim can be viewed from several different perspectives: from that of a flight vehicle model
developer, from that of an integrator who will incorporate JSBSim into a full flight simulation
architecture with visuals, and from that of a software developer who wants to adapt or enhance
JSBSim with additional capabilities.
