  description="Standard frames of reference with the origin at the aircraft center of mass $G$. In this particular
situation the air is calm and the velocity vector $\boldsymbol{v}_\mathrm{CM/E}$, of $G$ with respect to the Earth-fixed observer, is horizontal and pointing to North; hence it gives the direction of the relative wind. The standard three aerodynamic resultant force components $D$ (drag), $L$ (lift) and $Y_\mathrm{A}$ (side force) are also shown, with the angle of attack $\alpha_\mathrm{B}$ (referred to $x_\mathrm{B}$) and the angle of sideslip $\beta$. The aircraft weight is a vector of magnitude $W = mg$, directed downwards, parallel to $z_\mathrm{V}$ (the local vertical)."
